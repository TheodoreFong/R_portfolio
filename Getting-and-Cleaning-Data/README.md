## Course Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

Course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The course project of [Getting and Cleaning Data] is to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

**There are 5 main parts described in R script:**

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidy_data.txt](tidy_data.txt).**

**To understand more about each variables used in R script, you can read the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).**
